## Description

The project is a readme generator created using JS and it uses Node.js and inquirer to generate the readme based on user inputs.

## Installation

Once the code is pulled from Github, open a terminal to the repository and enter the following command minus the quotations to install Inquirer: "npm i inquirer@8.2.4".

## Usage

Once it is installed, simply open a terminal to the root folder containing the index.js file. Then run the following command: "node index.js" and complete the prompts.
